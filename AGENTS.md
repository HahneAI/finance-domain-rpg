# AGENTS.md — Authority Finance (Codex)

Codex-facing authority doc. Mirrors `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — both agents share the same rules.
**Keep under practical cap. Reference `docs/active-systems.md` for system detail; do not duplicate it here.**

## Product

**Authority Finance (A:Fin)** — flagship pillar of Authority OS.
Personal finance dashboard: income modeling, budgeting, goals, event logging.
Tagline: *"You are missing out… on you."*

## Environments — Pick the Right One Per Task

Three persistent environments are configured in Codex settings for this repo.
**Select the environment that matches your task domain before launching.**

| Environment | Use When Working On |
|---|---|
| `authority-finance-core` | `finance.js`, `rollingTimeline.js`, `constants/`, tax math, benefits pipeline, goal surplus engine |
| `authority-finance-ui` | `components/`, `ui.jsx`, `index.css`, single panel builds, auth flows, token/style changes |
| `authority-finance-audit` | `docs/` writes, value-flow traces, quarterly audits, expense mapping, source-of-truth checks |

---

## Commands

### Always Safe in Any Environment
```bash
npm ci                  # install — use this, not npm install
npm run lint            # ESLint 9
npm run test:run        # Vitest 4, single pass — PRIMARY validation
npx vitest run -u       # update snapshots (only after intentional DEFAULT_CONFIG changes)
```

### NOT Safe in Codex Sandbox
```bash
npm run build   # FAILS — @rolldown/plugin-babel + @tailwindcss/vite spawn native .node binaries (EPERM)
npm run dev     # FAILS — same reason
npm run typecheck  # does not exist — this is JSX, not TypeScript
```

**Prefer pure JS solutions.** If a task can be solved without native binaries, system calls, or compiled modules, do it that way. Sandbox EPERM errors are not recoverable mid-task.

**Test config:** Vitest auto-prefers `vitest.config.js` over `vite.config.js`. The separate config intentionally omits Tailwind, Rolldown, and LightningCSS to be sandbox-safe. Do not merge them.

**Reporter:** verbose is set — always read per-test output, not just the summary line. Vitest 4's default reporter can miscount failures.

---

## Architecture Pipeline

```
SetupWizard → config
    ↓
buildYear() → allWeeks[] (52 weeks, taxableGross, grossPay per week)
    ↓
computeNet(week, config, extraPerCheck) → per-check net
    ↓
projectedAnnualNet → weeklyIncome → baseWeeklyUnallocated
    ↓
eventImpact (logs) → adjustedWeeklyDelta, grossDeltaByWeek
    ↓
taxDerived (adjustedTaxableGross) → extraPerCheck (feeds back into computeNet)
    ↓
futureWeekNets[] → computeGoalTimeline() → goal fund sequences
```

See `docs/active-systems.md` for full per-system detail on all 11 live systems.

## Design Tokens (Never Use Raw Hex for These)

| Token | Value | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `--color-accent-primary` | `#00c896` | Teal — tabs, CTAs, section bars |
| `--color-green` | `#22c55e` | Positive financial values only |
| `--color-red` | `#ef4444` | Negative / spend / risk |
| `--color-bg-base` | `#05100c` | App shell background |
| `--color-bg-surface` | `#112c1f` | Card background |
| `--color-text-primary` | `#e6f4ef` | Body text |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `#7fa39a` | Labels |

Full token table: `src/index.css` `@theme` block. Never use old amber `#c9a84c`, old green `#4caf7d`, or DM Serif/DM Sans fonts.

## Active Task Backlog (Route to Correct Environment)

| # | Task | Environment |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | Profile auth flows (change email/password, delete, global sign-out) | `authority-finance-ui` |
| 2 | Fiscal week roadmap (unified week source, goal auto-complete, daily confirm) | `authority-finance-core` |
| 3 | 50-state tax audit + Missouri marginal bracket fix | `authority-finance-core` |
| 4 | DHL benefits deduction pipeline (all premiums → pre-tax deduction in `buildYear`) | `authority-finance-core` |
| 5 | Move tax plan from Income tab → Account › Tax Plan | `authority-finance-ui` |
| 6 | Income weekly overview sticky header | `authority-finance-ui` |
| 7 | Expense calculation audit log (trace, no math changes) | `authority-finance-audit` |

Full specs for tasks 1–7: `docs/codex-memory.md` §2026-04-03.

## Known Gaps — Do Not Paper Over

- `buildYear()` only subtracts `ltd + k401kEmployee` pre-tax. Insurance premiums, HSA/FSA, other deductions collected in config but not applied → taxable gross overstated. Task 4 fixes this.
- `wN` fallback for unfunded goals uses `remaining / avgNet` approximation → can diverge under volatile checks. Tracked, not blocking.
- `index.html` still loads DM Serif + DM Sans (dead weight) and has stale title/PWA label. Low priority.
- `WeekConfirmModal.jsx`, `LoginScreen.jsx`, `ProfilePanel.jsx` contain hardcoded hex — tokenization tracked in TODO §10.

---

## Guardrails

- **One task = one PR.** Do not bundle unrelated changes into a single commit or branch.
- **No refactors outside explicit task scope.**
- **Do not modify unrelated files.** If a file isn't in the task spec, don't touch it.
- **Preserve calculation outputs unless the task explicitly changes math.**
- **Do not introduce build-breaking changes.** If you can't run `npm run build` in sandbox, verify with `npm run test:run` and `npm run lint` at minimum — do not ship code you know is broken.
- **No `npm run build` in sandbox.** Use `npm run test:run` to validate instead.
- **Do not merge `vitest.config.js` into `vite.config.js`.**
- **Do not use raw hex for accent, green, or red.** Always reference tokens.
- **No new files unless the task spec requires them.**
- **Do not touch `finance.js`, `App.jsx`, or `rollingTimeline.js` from a UI-only task.**
- **`HomePanel.jsx` is encoding-sensitive.** Prior Codex sessions corrupted this file twice with mixed CRLF/duplicate blocks. Write clean LF-only output and do not append stray JSX after closing braces.

---

## Task Output Format

When completing any task, return a structured summary in this format:

```
files_changed:         [list every file modified, created, or deleted]
changes_made:          [one sentence per file — what changed and why]
affected_calculation_paths: [which pipeline stages were touched, if any — buildYear / computeNet /
                        computeGoalTimeline / calcEventImpact / rollingTimeline / none]
validation_result:     [output of npm run lint && npm run test:run — pass / fail + relevant lines]
new_risks_detected:    [any regressions, edge cases, or known gaps introduced or observed]
```

`affected_calculation_paths` is required even when the answer is "none" — it forces an explicit check that UI or config changes did not inadvertently reach the finance pipeline.
