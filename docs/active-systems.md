## 1. Expense Drag-and-Drop Reorder

Supports both mouse drag and touch (450ms hold-to-drag) within the Expenses tab.

**Mouse drag:** `onExpenseDragStart` → `EXPENSE_DRAG_PREVIEW_TINT` fades card toward destination category color on hover → `reorderExpenseByInsert()` splices dragged card into the correct insert-index position and updates `category` if cross-lane. Preview resets on drop/leave/cancel.

**Touch drag:** Ghost overlay follows finger. Edge proximity triggers `runTouchAutoScroll` (rAF loop, max 18px/frame). Drop resolves via `expenseTouchInsertRef` position. Exit fade on 130ms timer.

**Reorder logic:** `reorderExpenseByInsert(draggedId, lane, insertIndex)` — walks `regularExpenses` to find the correct splice point, mutates category to `targetLane`, preserves loan ordering separately.

**Categories:** Needs / Lifestyle (cross-lane drag supported). Goals tab uses `GOAL_LANES` colors for inline labels only — not split containers.

**Open issue:** Task 1 post-commit noted Goals tab was accidentally given Expenses/Lifestyle split containers. Code audit shows Goals renders as a single list with lane badges inline per card — appears resolved, but needs visual QA confirmation.

## 2. Expense Inline Editor + Pay Cycle Math

**Cycle options:** weekly (7d), biweekly (14d), every30days, yearly (365d).
`PAYCHECK_CADENCE_DAYS = 7` — one check per fiscal week.

**Core formula:**
```
perPaycheck = amount × 7 / cycleDays
monthly     = perPaycheck × 4   (PAYCHECKS_PER_MONTH, not calendar days)
```

**Effective start date:** new expenses use `TODAY_ISO` as `effectiveFrom`. Edit: if last history entry is ≤3 days old, updates in place; otherwise appends a new history entry. No backfill.

**Phase-aware:** `billingMeta.byPhase[ap]` stores per-phase `{amount, cycle, effectiveFrom}`. `getEffectiveAmount()` resolves the correct history entry for the active phase and date.

**Edit flow:** `startEditExp` reverse-converts stored `perPaycheck → cycle amount` via `cycleAmountFromPerPaycheck` for display in the inline editor.

---

## 3. Goals Timeline — Monthly/Weekly Grid

**Location:** `BudgetPanel.jsx` Goals view, uses `computeGoalTimeline()` from `finance.js`.

**Timeline structure:** Month-labeled track built from `futureWeeks`. Each month renders `MONTH_SUBDIVISIONS = 4` subtle internal blocks. `deriveRollingTimelineMonths()` filters visible months (see System 4).

**Goal bar positioning:** `computeGoalTimeline()` runs week-by-week surplus sequencing — each loop week: `weeklyNets[weekOffset] - futureEventDeductions - effectiveNonTransferSpend - smearedPastLoss + smearedGain`. Goals funded in list order. Start week `sW` and duration `wN` map to month position proportionally, including mid-month stops.

**Known gap:** `wN` fallback for unfunded goals uses `remaining / avgNet` approximation — can diverge from true week-by-week surplus under volatile checks (partial-year extrapolation).

---

## 4. Rolling Active Views + Progressive Scaling

**Library:** `src/lib/rollingTimeline.js` — three pure exports.

**Weekly (IncomePanel):**
`deriveRollingIncomeWeeks(allWeeks, todayIso, 4)` → shows last 4 completed weeks + current week + all remaining weeks through EOY. Older weeks hidden; data preserved in `hiddenWeeks`.

**Monthly (BudgetPanel goals):**
`deriveRollingTimelineMonths(monthSegments, todayIso, 1)` → shows previous month + current month + all remaining months through EOY. Older months in `hiddenMonths`.

**Progressive scaling:**
`progressiveScale(scaleProgress, 0.15)` → `1 + (progress × 0.15)`. Returns 1.00x at year start, 1.15x at EOY. `scaleProgress` = hidden periods / max possible hidden periods. Applied as `weeklyDensityScale` in IncomePanel weekly rows.

**Hidden data** preserved in derived structures for future full-year review tab.

---

## 5. Adjusted Take-Home / Tax Payback Pipeline

**Event impact engine (`App.jsx` `eventImpact` memo):**
Loops all logs → `calcEventImpact(e, config)` per entry → accumulates:
- `netLost` / `netGained` — total net delta
- `missedEventDayNetLost` — absence-type events only (feeds Task 7 modal)
- `weeklyNetAdjustments[idx]` — per-week net delta map
- `grossDeltaByWeek[idx]` — per-week gross delta (feeds tax recalc)
- `futureEventDeductionsByWeek[idx]` — future weeks only (feeds goal surplus)

**Tax payback adjustment:**
`adjustedTaxableGrossByWeek[idx] = taxableGross + grossDeltaByWeek[idx]`
Feeds full federal (`fedTax`) and state (`stateTax`) liability recalculation → recomputes `fedGap`, `moGap` → `extraPerCheck = targetExtraTotal / taxedWeekCount`. Missed days reduce gross → lower projected tax owed.

**Downstream consumers:**
- `adjustedWeeklyAvg = baseWeeklyUnallocated + (totalNetAdjustment / futureWeekCount)`
- `futureWeekNets[]` — per-week spendable net, buffer-excluded, fed to `computeGoalTimeline`
- `logTotals.adjustedTakeHome = projectedAnnualNet + totalNetAdjustment`

---

## 6. Expense Pay Period vs Monthly Display

**Resolved — by design.** Monthly cost = `perPaycheck × 4` (paycheck-based month, not calendar). This is intentional: app runs on weekly fiscal cadence, so 4 checks = 1 "month." Not a math error. `cycleAmountFromPerPaycheck` reverse-converts for editor display. Documented as resolved in task audit.

---

## 7. Year Summary — Adjusted Net + Event Loss

**IncomePanel** receives `adjustedTakeHome` and `missedEventDayNetLost` as props (from `App.jsx` `logTotals`).

**Year Summary card:** Displays `adjustedTakeHome` (not raw projected net) as "Adjusted Net" with `missedEventDayNetLost` as sublabel: `"$X missed-day loss"` shown in red when non-zero.

**Inline breakdown row** (IncomePanel lines 226–230): Shows missed-day loss in red and adjusted take-home in gold as a consolidated callout — replaces the old separate yellow/red adjusted take-home component.

**Source of truth:** `adjustedTakeHome = projectedAnnualNet + eventImpact.totalNetAdjustment`. Card and breakdown row use same prop — no divergence risk.

---

## 8. Log Tab — Hero + Log Effect Summary

**Three hero cards:** net loss (`tot.nL`), PTO loss (`tot.pto` hours), bucket hours lost (`tot.bucket`). Larger week-naming card and bucket hour bar card preserved.

**Log Effect Summary card** (single card, no internal background separation):
- `adjTH = projectedAnnualNet - tot.nL + tot.nG` — adjusted annual take-home
- `adjWA = baseWeeklyUnallocated - (tot.nL / weeksLeft) + (tot.nG / weeksLeft)` — adjusted weekly avg
- `projS = adjWA × weeksLeft` — projected savings
- Displays: adjusted take-home, adjusted weekly avg, projected savings vs total unfunded goals, weeks-to-fund estimate

**Attendance history** section: groups absence-type logs by calendar month, counts unpaid shifts, unapproved days, partial shifts. Day-of-week miss frequency sorted descending. Explanatory text box removed.

---

## 9. Loan payoff quarter persistence

**History rebuild:** `buildLoanHistory()` still regenerates a runway entry (`loanRunwayStartDate` + `loanWeeklyAmount`) per loan and a payoff entry, but the payoff entry now becomes effective the day after the quarter-end boundary that contains `computeLoanPayoffDate(loan)`. Helpers `getQuarterEndIsoForDate` (one of the new helper exports) and `addDaysToIso` derive that boundary from ISO cutoffs (Q1=Mar 31, Q2=Jun 30, Q3=Sep 30, Q4=Dec 31).

**Quarter coverage:** Loans closing in July or August now keep their weekly allocation (e.g., Laptop \$33/wk, AirPods \$17.50/wk) visible through Q3 totals, so the quarterly spend audits and Budget tab phase math never drop them to zero before `2026-10-01`.

**Why this matters:** A loan payoff happening mid-quarter previously zeroed the cost for that entire quarter; now the cost is kept alive through the quarter that contains the final payment, ensuring totals, goals, and console audit logs stay aligned with the user’s expectation that a loan “still exists” until the quarter closes.

## Core Architecture

```
SetupWizard → config
    ↓
buildYear() → allWeeks[] (52 weeks, taxableGross, grossPay per week)
    ↓
computeNet(week, config, extraPerCheck) → per-check net
    ↓
projectedAnnualNet → weeklyIncome → baseWeeklyUnallocated
    ↓
eventImpact (logs) → adjustedWeeklyDelta, grossDeltaByWeek
    ↓
taxDerived (adjustedTaxableGross) → extraPerCheck (feeds back into computeNet)
    ↓
futureWeekNets[] → computeGoalTimeline() → goal fund sequences
```

**Key constants:** `FISCAL_YEAR_START`, `PAYCHECK_CADENCE_DAYS = 7`, `PAYCHECKS_PER_MONTH = 4`

**Known gap:** `buildYear()` only applies `ltd` + `k401kEmployee` to pre-tax deductions. Insurance premiums and HSA/FSA contributions collected in config but not subtracted → taxable gross overstated. Tracked in TODO §8.

**Persistence:** localStorage via `src/lib/db.js`. Supabase for multi-user (auth live). No schema changes made by Tasks 1–8.

## Setup Wizard

**File:** `src/components/SetupWizard.jsx` — shipped. Consolidated from 10 steps → 6 (2026-03-31).

**Entry:** `App.jsx` checks `!config.setupComplete` on load → renders wizard. On completion writes `setupComplete: true` and redirects to income view. Re-accessible from sidebar "Life Events" menu for job changes without wiping unrelated config.

**6-step flow:**
1. **Welcome** — first-run intro or life event select (lost job / changed jobs / commission)
2. **Pay Structure** — base rate, shift hours, OT threshold/multiplier, weekend diff; DHL users also complete team A/B, shift type (night/morning), rotation, and OT day preference inline (was separate Step 15)
3. **Schedule** — job start date → `firstActiveIdx`, rotation week (DHL short/long), pay period close day
4. **Deductions** — benefits multi-select with inline config (401k, health, dental, vision, LTD, STD, life, HSA, FSA), benefits start date, freeform other-deductions rows, attendance policy gate (merged from old Step 6)
5. **Tax Rates** — state dropdown, paystub calculator (skippable), rate summary card now shows FICA + standard deduction inline (old Step 5 absorbed here)
6. **Wrap Up** — live estimated net breakdown, paycheck buffer toggle ($0–200/wk), tax-exempt week disclaimer gate (non-blocking; merged from old Steps 7+8)

**`STEP_DEFS` shape:** `{ id, title, showIf(formData, lifeEvent), isValid(formData, lifeEvent), skippable?, component }`. `activeSteps = STEP_DEFS.filter(showIf)` — progress bar and step counter derived from that filtered array. Life event routing gates Steps 3 and 6 (`null` | `changed_jobs` only).

**Employer preset:** `employerPreset: "DHL"` activates bucket attendance model, rotation-based scheduling, dual withholding rates, and DHL team/shift fields in Step 2. `isValid` for Step 2 requires `dhlTeam !== null` when DHL. Standard users get flat weekly hours model.

**Tax rates policy:** Paystub not required. Step 5 pre-fills from `STATE_TAX_TABLE`; users sharpen later via Income → Sharpen Rates (same calc UI, no wizard re-run).

**Token standard:** All rgba values use teal `rgba(0,200,150,...)` and green `rgba(34,197,94,...)` — old amber `rgba(201,168,76,...)` and old green `rgba(76,175,125,...)` fully removed.

## Rolling Active Views — QA Notes

Testing requires manual date simulation (no date override utility yet):
1. Near year start — minimal hidden periods, scale near 1.00x
2. Mid-year — some hidden periods, subtle scale increase visible
3. Near EOY — many hidden periods, scale near 1.15x cap

Hidden weeks/months preserved in `hiddenWeeks` / `hiddenMonths` arrays from `rollingTimeline.js` — ready for a future full-year review tab without data migration.

## 10. Funded goal absorption integrity (2026-04-03)

**Objective:** prevent funded-goal dollars from re-entering future surplus projections while avoiding double subtraction across weekly averages and year-end rollups.

**Current behavior:**
- `getFundedGoalSpend(goals, todayIso)` (new helper) sums completed goal targets as absorbed spend, ignores future-dated completions, and counts legacy completed goals without `completedAt`.
- App-level `baseWeeklyUnallocated` remains the pure paycheck-minus-expense baseline; funded-goal absorption is applied in projection summaries instead of being smeared into baseline weekly math.
- Budget/Home/Log projection surfaces consume `fundedGoalSpend` so funded amounts stay deducted once from year-end-style totals and cannot drift back into available surplus.

**Guardrail note:** this separation (baseline weekly surplus vs absorbed-goal projection adjustments) prevents the prior “spread + explicit subtract” double-count pattern.
