# Plan: Setup Wizard (TODO Section 4)

## Context for New Sessions

This is the primary implementation document for the setup wizard. Read this before touching any wizard-related code.

**What this wizard is:** A multi-step onboarding flow that replaces all hardcoded single-user config values (currently Anthony's DHL account) with a user-facing setup process that works for any user. Every income calculation in the app flows from `DEFAULT_CONFIG` — the wizard is how new users populate it.

**Current app state:** All config is hardcoded for Anthony (DHL warehouse worker, Missouri, rotating 12hr shifts). Supabase persistence is live. No auth. No setup wizard yet. Finance.js `buildYear()` and `computeNet()` use hardcoded rotation strings and `w1/w2` rate fields that only make sense for Anthony's schedule.

**Key architectural decision:** Anthony's DHL-specific setup (heavy/light week rotation, dual withholding rates, bucket attendance model) is handled via an `employerPreset: "DHL"` flag. Standard users get a simpler flat weekly hours model. See `docs/setup-wizard-field-notes.md` for the full field-by-field decision log.

**Anthony migration:** When Phase 1 ships, a one-time migration in `db.js` detects Anthony's existing pre-wizard Supabase row (by absence of `setupComplete`) and sets `employerPreset: "DHL"`, copies legacy rate fields to the new names, and marks `setupComplete: true` — so Anthony never sees the wizard but the app is now multi-user ready structurally.

---

## Paystub Policy — Do Not Require at Setup

**Paystubs are never required to complete the wizard.** Users skip the tax calculator in Step 4 and proceed with state-table pre-fills (estimates). The app uses these estimates until the user sharpens them.

**What we build instead:**
- Step 4 tax calculator fields are clearly marked optional — pre-filled from `STATE_TAX_TABLE` so the app is immediately useful
- Persistent reminders surface in IncomePanel and the dashboard nudging users to input actual withheld amounts from a real paystub to lock in exact rates
- A dedicated "Sharpen your tax rates" entry point is accessible anytime from Settings — same paystub calculator UI, no full wizard re-run needed
- Every budget projection shows an "estimate" badge on tax-derived numbers until actual paystub rates are confirmed

The copy in Step 4 and the welcome screen reflects this: *"You don't need your paystub today — but as soon as you can input the tax numbers the government took off of you, the sooner we can sharpen your budget to exact pennies."*

---

## Overview

A multi-step setup wizard that serves as the first page seen after sign-in when no saved config is detected. Also re-accessible from a sidebar life event menu ("Lost my job", "Changed jobs", "Got a commission job") to reset and re-configure affected fields without wiping unrelated config.

---

## Entry Points

### First-Run Gate
- App.jsx checks on load: `if (!loading && !config.setupComplete)` → render `<SetupWizard />`
- After wizard completes → writes `config.setupComplete = true` → saves → redirects to `/income` (or just sets topNav)
- "setupComplete" added to `DEFAULT_CONFIG` as `false`

### Life Event Re-Entry (Sidebar Menu)
- New sidebar item: **"Life Events"** — opens a modal or navigates to the wizard with a life event pre-selected
- Life events:
  - **Lost my job** → clears Pay Structure + Schedule + Deductions + Tax Rates; keeps Benefits capture; marks setupComplete=false so wizard re-runs
  - **Changed jobs** → full wizard re-run; pre-fills FICA (rarely changes) and Annual Tax Strategy; clears the rest
  - **Got a commission job** → flags commission mode; adds commission income field to Pay Structure; flags that OT/shift-based logic doesn't fully apply
- Re-entry pre-fills all surviving fields from current config; only affected steps are cleared/editable

---

## Wizard Steps

Steps render sequentially. Each step has: title, plain-English explanation ("what this affects" + "where to find it"), input fields, validation, Next / Back navigation.

---

### Step 0 — Welcome (first-run only) / Life Event Select (re-entry)

**First-run:**
> "Welcome to Life RPG Finance. Before we build your dashboard, let's capture your pay setup. This takes about 3 minutes. You'll be able to update anything anytime from the Life Events menu."

No fields. Just a Start button.

**Re-entry:**
- Dropdown: select life event type
- Dependency engine reads selection and marks downstream steps dirty/clean

---

### Step 1 — Pay Structure

**What it affects:** Every gross income calculation in the app.
**Where to find it:** Your offer letter or most recent paystub.

**Employer preset gate (shown first, before any pay fields):**

> "Do you work for DHL?"

- Pill: **Yes** · **No**
- Writes: `employerPreset: "DHL" | null`
- **DHL = Yes:** auto-sets `scheduleIsVariable = true`; activates bucket attendance model; unlocks DHL rotation picker in Step 2; skips Step 6 attendance policy gate (DHL always has bucket tracking); pre-loads bucket defaults (`bucketStartBalance: 64`, `bucketCap: 128`, `bucketPayoutRate: 9.825`)
- **No:** standard path — `scheduleIsVariable` defaults false; Step 4 asks hours-vary question normally; Step 6 attendance gate shown

Note: This gate is the foundation for future employer presets (UPS, Amazon warehouse, etc.) — same pattern, different defaults.

| Field | Input | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Base hourly rate | $ number | e.g. 19.65 |
| Shift length | hrs number | e.g. 10 |
| Weekend differential | $ number | extra $/hr for weekend shifts; 0 if none |
| OT threshold | hrs/wk number | default 40; some contracts differ |
| OT multiplier | × number | default 1.5 |

**Commission mode flag** (if life event = commission job):
- Toggle: "My pay includes commission (not just hourly)"
- Adds: Commission estimate (monthly average $) — used for income projection

---

### Step 2 — Schedule

**What it affects:** Which weeks generate income, your baseline hours, and all date-sensitive calculations.
**Where to find it:** Your start date and your first paystub.

| Field | Input | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Job start date | date picker | Used to derive `firstActiveIdx` |
| Standard weekly hours | number | **Standard path only** — "How many hours do you work in a typical week?" (e.g. 40). Deviations logged via weekly check-in. |
| DHL rotation phase | Pill: **Currently on 4-day week** · **Currently on 6-day week** | **DHL preset only** — shown if `employerPreset = "DHL"`. Writes `startingWeekIsHeavy: false | true`. Used by `buildYear()` to alternate light/heavy rate assignment from `firstActiveIdx`. |
| Pay period end day | Day-of-week picker (Sun–Sat) | Which day your pay week closes; used to trigger weekly work confirmation modal (`config.payPeriodEndDay`, 0=Sun default) |

Plain-English note (pay period end day): "This tells the app when to prompt you to confirm what you actually worked each week. Typically Sunday if your work week runs Monday–Sunday."

Plain-English note (DHL rotation): "This tells the app whether your current paycheck is from a lighter 4-day week or a heavier 6-day week. It needs to know which one you're on right now so it can alternate correctly for the rest of the year."

---

### Step 3 — Deductions

**What it affects:** Your net take-home on every paycheck.
**Where to find it:** Your benefits enrollment confirmation or paystub deduction breakdown.

| Field | Input | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| LTD (Long-Term Disability) | $ / week | Check paystub; enter 0 if not enrolled |
| 401k employee contribution | % | e.g. 6 |
| Employer match | % | e.g. 3 (match up to X%) |
| 401k enrollment start date | date | Leave blank if already active |

Dependency: if 401k enrollment date is in the future, app shows countdown in Benefits panel (already implemented).

---

### Step 4 — Tax Rates

**What it affects:** How much is withheld from each paycheck and your projected year-end tax balance.
**Where to find it:** One or two recent paystubs — but this step is skippable. State-table estimates pre-fill the rates so the app works immediately. Reminders to sharpen with a real paystub surface throughout the app post-setup.

**Gate question (shown first):**
> "Does your gross pay change week to week?"
- Pill: **Yes, it varies** · **No, it's consistent**
- **Yes** → two paystub calculators shown (light week + heavy week)
- **No** → one paystub calculator shown; single rate used for all weeks

**State question:**
> "What state do you live in?"
- State dropdown → app pre-fills state rate from lookup table
- User confirms against their paystub in the calculator below

**Paystub calculator UI (shown once or twice based on gate above) — optional, skippable:**
> "Got a paystub handy? Drop in your numbers and we'll nail your exact rates. No paystub yet? No problem — we'll use your state's standard rate as an estimate and remind you to sharpen it later."
- Input: Gross pay that check *(optional — skip pre-fills state table estimate)*
- Input: Federal income tax withheld *(optional)*
- Input: State income tax withheld *(optional)*
- App derives and displays: federal rate = withheld ÷ gross, state rate = withheld ÷ gross
- User confirms (or adjusts if paystub had an anomaly)
- **Skip path:** user clicks "Use estimate for now" → rates pre-filled from STATE_TAX_TABLE; "estimate" badge shown on tax-derived numbers in IncomePanel until confirmed

| Stored Field | Replaces | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `scheduleIsVariable` | *(new)* | Drives whether one or two calculators shown; persists to inform `buildYear()` logic |
| `userState` | *(new)* | Two-letter state code; drives state rate pre-fill and Annual Tax Strategy step |
| `fedRateLow` | `w1FedRate` | Federal rate on lighter/consistent paycheck |
| `fedRateHigh` | `w2FedRate` | Federal rate on heavier paycheck (equals fedRateLow if not variable) |
| `stateRateLow` | `w1StateRate` | State rate on lighter/consistent paycheck |
| `stateRateHigh` | `w2StateRate` | State rate on heavier paycheck (equals stateRateLow if not variable) |
| `ficaRate` | — | Pre-filled 7.65% (W-2 employee share: 6.2% SS + 1.45% Medicare). Read-only — no user input. If pay type = self-employed/1099, auto-set to 15.3% instead. SS wage cap ($176,100 for 2026) not a concern at this income level. |

Plain-English note shown at top of step: "You don't need your paystub today — but as soon as you can input the tax numbers the government took off of you, the sooner we can sharpen your budget to exact pennies. For now, we'll estimate from your state's rate."

---

### Step 5 — Annual Tax Strategy

**What it affects:** Whether you're projected to owe at filing, and how much extra to withhold per check.
**Where to find it:** Last year's tax return (line 61 for amount owed). Missouri uses a flat rate derived from your state selection in Step 4.

**Standard deduction assumption (shown as a disclosure at the top of this step):**
> "All tax projections use the federal standard deduction ($15,000 for 2026 single filers). If you itemize deductions, your actual tax liability may be lower — but we keep things simple here. A full deductions breakdown is available as an optional advanced setup."

`fedStdDeduction` is pre-filled and read-only. Not shown as an editable input — it's a system constant updated annually.

| Field | Input | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| MO flat rate | % | Pre-filled from `userState` lookup; shown for confirmation, not entry |
| Target amount owed at filing | $ | 0 = break even; small positive = safer than refund |

Plain-English note: "If you enter $200 here, the app will calculate how much extra to withhold each check so you owe exactly $200 at filing — not a surprise bill, not a big refund you didn't earn."

---

### Step 6 — Benefits Capture

**What it affects:** Your net paycheck (health insurance deduction), PTO accrual tracking, and paternity leave planning in the Benefits panel.
**Where to find it:** Your benefits enrollment email or HR portal.

| Field | Input | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Health insurance deduction | $ / paycheck | Enter 0 if not enrolled yet |
| Benefits start date | date | When health/dental/vision kicks in |
| Any other recurring deductions | repeatable $ field | Label + amount (e.g. "Dental: $12") |

**Attendance policy gate (shown at end of Step 6 — standard path only):**

Skipped entirely if `employerPreset = "DHL"` — DHL users have bucket tracking auto-enabled from Step 1.

> "Does your employer have a formal attendance policy — like a points or hours-based system?"

- Pill: **Yes — points or hours based** · **No — standard time-off tracking**
- **Yes** → enables simplified bucket tracker (hours-based policy assumed; intake rates adjustable from Settings)
- **No** → log-based attendance history only: no bucket math; missed days visible in event log history
- **All users** get: attendance history view (missed days, monthly trend) — gate only controls whether bucket model is active

---

### Step 7 — Paycheck Buffer

**What it affects:** A safety floor applied to every unallocated income calculation. Any surplus below this threshold is treated as "spoken for."
**Where to find it:** Nowhere — you set this. It's your buffer.

Show: projected net per check (calculated live from steps 1–6).

| Field | Input | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Safety buffer per check | $ | Minimum $50 enforced; default $50 |

Plain-English note: "Life is unpredictable. This buffer reserves a slice of each paycheck for things the app doesn't know about — a co-pay, a car issue, a last-minute grocery run. $50 is the floor; go higher if your life has more noise."

Validation: warn if user enters < 50; block save until corrected or explicitly overridden with confirmation.

---

### Step 8 — Tax Exempt Gate (Visual Testing Sprint)

Three UI options to test at the end of the feature sprint. Implement all three, gate behind a flag, A/B test visually. Pick winner before launch.

**Context:** Tax schedule controls (per-week taxed/exempt toggles, extra withholding toggle) are advanced and carry personal liability risk. User must opt in after reading a disclaimer before these controls unlock.

**Disclaimer text:**
> "Heads up — adjusting your withholding or exemption status can affect how much you owe at tax time. Life RPG helps you plan and visualize your finances, but we're not a tax advisor. If you're unsure, a quick chat with a CPA before changing your W-4 can save you a headache come April. You've got this — just go in informed."

**Option A — Blur + Lock overlay:**
- Tax schedule section renders normally but is covered by a frosted/blurred overlay
- Overlay shows a padlock icon + short prompt + "Enable Advanced Tax Controls" button
- Clicking button shows disclaimer modal → Accept → overlay removed → controls unlock

**Option B — Hidden, revealed by link:**
- Tax schedule section is completely absent from the UI
- In IncomePanel, a small muted "Advanced" text link appears below the relevant section
- Clicking "Advanced" shows the disclaimer inline (no modal) → Accept → section appears

**Option C — Locked placeholder card:**
- Tax schedule section replaced by a single locked card with:
  - Section title (grayed)
  - "🔒 Advanced — Tax Schedule Controls"
  - One-sentence description of what's behind the lock
  - "Learn more & enable" button → disclaimer modal → Accept → card replaced with real controls

**Acceptance persistence:** once accepted, `config.taxExemptOptIn = true` saves to Supabase. User never sees the gate again unless they clear data.

---

## Dependency Engine (Step Routing)

```
lifeEvent = null (first-run)     → show all steps 0–8
lifeEvent = "Lost my job"        → show steps 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 only; preserve 5, 6, 7; skip 8
lifeEvent = "Changed jobs"       → show all steps 0–8; pre-fill FICA + tax strategy fields
lifeEvent = "Commission job"     → show steps 0, 1 (with commission flag), 2, 3, 4, 5; skip 6, 7
```

Each step checks: does a dependency make this step irrelevant? If yes, auto-skip (no user sees it).

---

## Files to Create / Modify

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/constants/config.js` | Add 6 new fields to DEFAULT_CONFIG |
| `src/lib/db.js` | Fix config merge strategy; add Anthony migration block |
| `src/lib/finance.js` | Update `buildYear()` rotation logic; add `stateTax()` (state sprint) |
| `src/constants/stateTaxTable.js` | **Create** — 50-state tax table (state sprint) |
| `src/components/SetupWizard.jsx` | **Create** — full multi-step wizard component |
| `src/App.jsx` | First-run gate; `handleWizardComplete`; Life Events sidebar item |
| `src/components/IncomePanel.jsx` | Tax exempt gate (3 UI options behind flag) |
| `docs/TODO.md` | Mark Section 4 items complete as shipped |

---

## Build Order

### Phase 1 — Foundation (do this first, before any wizard UI)

**Step 1 — `src/constants/config.js`**
Add to DEFAULT_CONFIG:
```js
setupComplete: false,
taxExemptOptIn: false,
paycheckBuffer: 50,
employerPreset: null,       // "DHL" | null
startingWeekIsHeavy: null,  // DHL only: true = first active week is 6-day (72hr)
userState: "MO",            // state sprint
```
Remove `w1FedRate`, `w2FedRate`, `w1StateRate`, `w2StateRate` from DEFAULT_CONFIG — replaced by `fedRateLow`, `fedRateHigh`, `stateRateLow`, `stateRateHigh` (wizard-derived, not hardcoded).

**Step 2 — `src/lib/db.js` — config merge fix (critical)**

Current behavior: `data.config || DEFAULT_CONFIG` — entire DEFAULT_CONFIG is discarded if any config row exists. New fields added to DEFAULT_CONFIG will never reach existing users.

Fix in `loadUserData()`:
```js
// Before (broken for new fields):
config: Object.keys(data.config).length ? data.config : DEFAULT_CONFIG,

// After (new DEFAULT_CONFIG fields fill in for existing rows):
config: { ...DEFAULT_CONFIG, ...data.config },
```

**Step 3 — `src/lib/db.js` — Anthony migration block**

Add after the merge fix, before returning:
```js
// Anthony account migration — set DHL preset on existing row
if (mergedConfig.employerPreset === null) {
  mergedConfig.employerPreset = "DHL";
  mergedConfig.startingWeekIsHeavy = true; // Anthony's first active week is 6-day
}
// Keep moFlatRate in config for now; state sprint will remove it once stateTax() is wired
```
This runs once; after wizard completes, `setupComplete: true` prevents re-entry and these values are confirmed.

---

### Phase 2 — finance.js updates (before wizard UI — wizard previews depend on these)

**Step 4 — `src/lib/finance.js` — decouple rotation from hardcoded strings**

In `buildYear()`, replace the `rotation === "6-Day"` / `rotation === "4-Day"` string checks with config-driven logic:
- If `config.employerPreset === "DHL"`: alternate heavy/light starting from `config.startingWeekIsHeavy` at `firstActiveIdx`; even/odd determines which is which
- If standard user (`employerPreset === null`): all active weeks use `config.standardWeeklyHours` (new field from wizard Step 2); no rotation concept

In `computeNet()`, replace `w1FedRate`/`w2FedRate` references:
- DHL: use `fedRateLow` for light weeks, `fedRateHigh` for heavy weeks
- Standard: use `fedRateLow` for all weeks (wizard sets `fedRateHigh === fedRateLow` when not variable)
- Backward compat: if `fedRateLow` not set yet (old row before wizard), fall back to `w1FedRate`

**Step 5 — `src/constants/stateTaxTable.js` + `src/lib/finance.js` — state sprint**

Per the state sprint plan already in this doc:
1. Create `stateTaxTable.js` with NONE + FLAT states; stub progressive states as FLAT with TODO comments
2. Add `stateTax(income, stateConfig)` to `finance.js`
3. In `App.jsx` `taxDerived`, replace `moFlatRate` usage with `stateTax(fAGI, STATE_TAX_TABLE[config.userState])`
4. Keep `moFlatRate` in config as read-only fallback; remove after migration confirmed

---

### Phase 3 — SetupWizard component

**Step 6 — Create `src/components/SetupWizard.jsx` — scaffold**

Wizard state shape:
```js
const [step, setStep] = useState(0);
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ ...config }); // pre-fills on re-entry
```

Navigation: Back / Next buttons; progress indicator (step X of 8); Next disabled until current step validates.

Step router — array of step components, filtered by `lifeEvent` + `employerPreset`:
```
steps = [Step0, Step1, Step2, Step3, Step4, Step5, Step6, Step7, Step8]
activeSteps = steps.filter(s => s.showIf(formData, lifeEvent))
```

On wizard complete:
```js
function handleComplete(finalData) {
  // Auto-populate taxedWeeks: all weeks from firstActiveIdx onward
  const taxedWeeks = allWeeks
    .filter(w => w.idx >= finalData.firstActiveIdx)
    .map(w => w.idx);
  onComplete({ ...finalData, taxedWeeks, setupComplete: true });
}
```

**Step 7 — Implement steps in order (one step = one sitting)**

Each step: title, plain-English blurb, inputs, inline validation, Next gated on valid.

| Sitting | Step | Key implementation notes |
|---------|------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Step 0 | Welcome copy + Start button; Life Event dropdown on re-entry; dependency engine sets `lifeEvent` |
| 2 | Step 1 | DHL pill gate first → writes `employerPreset`; then Pay Structure fields; commission toggle if life event = commission |
| 3 | Step 2 | Job start date → derives `firstActiveIdx` from `FISCAL_YEAR_START`; standard path shows weekly hours input; DHL path shows 4-day/6-day pill → `startingWeekIsHeavy` |
| 4 | Step 3 | Benefits availability gate (enrolled / not yet / none) → shows/hides LTD + 401k fields conditionally |
| 5 | Step 4 | Variable hours gate (`scheduleIsVariable`) — auto-true for DHL; state dropdown → pre-fills rate from STATE_TAX_TABLE; one or two paystub calculators (gross + withheld → derives rate) |
| 6 | Step 5 | Standard deduction disclosure (read-only); state rate shown/hidden based on model; `targetOwedAtFiling` input |
| 7 | Step 6 | Health deduction + benefits start date + repeatable other deductions; attendance gate at bottom (skip if DHL) |
| 8 | Step 7 | Live net-per-check preview (computed from formData so far); `paycheckBuffer` input; $50 floor validation |
| 9 | Step 8 | Tax Exempt Gate — implement all 3 options (A/B/C) behind a `GATE_VARIANT` constant; pick winner after visual test |

---

### Phase 4 — App.jsx integration

**Step 8 — First-run gate**
```jsx
// In App.jsx render, before main layout:
if (!config.setupComplete) {
  return <SetupWizard config={config} onComplete={handleWizardComplete} />;
}
```

`handleWizardComplete(newConfig)`:
- Merge `newConfig` into state
- Save to Supabase immediately
- `setupComplete: true` persists — gate never triggers again

**Step 9 — Life Events sidebar item**
- New sidebar entry: "Life Events"
- Opens modal: select event type (Lost my job / Changed jobs / Got a commission job)
- On select: set `lifeEvent`, clear affected config fields, set `setupComplete: false` → wizard re-runs with pre-fills intact for surviving fields

---

### Phase 5 — Tax Exempt Gate in IncomePanel

**Step 10 — `src/components/IncomePanel.jsx`**
- Wrap the Tax Schedule view (per-week toggles, extra withholding controls) with gate logic
- Gate reads `config.taxExemptOptIn`
- Implement all 3 options behind `const GATE_VARIANT = 'A'` (or 'B' / 'C')
- Run all 3 visually; pick winner; delete the losers before merging
- On accept: write `taxExemptOptIn: true` → save → gate never shown again

---

### Verification (run in order after build)

1. Clear Supabase config (or use incognito) → wizard appears on load, main app blocked
2. Complete wizard as standard user (No DHL) → `setupComplete: true` saved → main app loads
3. Complete wizard as DHL user → `employerPreset: "DHL"`, `startingWeekIsHeavy` set → heavy/light income projections match hand-calculated values
4. Anthony's existing row loads → DHL migration fires → `employerPreset: "DHL"` written → no income math regression
5. Sidebar "Life Events" → "Changed jobs" → wizard opens with FICA + tax strategy pre-filled; Pay Structure blank
6. Set buffer to $30 → validation error; $50 → saves fine
7. State sprint: switch `userState` to "TX" → state liability $0; Step 5 hides state rate field
8. Tax Exempt Gate: toggle `GATE_VARIANT` between A/B/C → all 3 render correctly; accept → `taxExemptOptIn: true` → gate gone on reload

---

## Verification

1. Fresh Supabase row (or clear config) → wizard appears on load, Income panel not accessible until wizard completes
2. Complete wizard → `setupComplete: true` saved → redirects to Income panel
3. Sidebar "Life Events" → "Changed jobs" → wizard opens with FICA + tax strategy pre-filled, Pay Structure fields blank
4. Set buffer to $30 → validation error shown; $50 → saves fine
5. Tax exempt gate: toggle flag between A/B/C → verify each option renders correctly in IncomePanel
6. Accept disclaimer → `taxExemptOptIn: true` written → gate never shown again on reload

---

*Last updated: 2026-03-24 — Build Order expanded to full phase-by-phase implementation plan. Phase 1: config fields + db.js migration fix (critical — merge strategy change). Phase 2: finance.js rotation decoupling + state sprint. Phase 3: SetupWizard scaffold + 9 step sittings. Phase 4: App.jsx gate + Life Events. Phase 5: Tax Exempt Gate in IncomePanel. Verification checklist added.*

# Sprint: State Tax Table + userState Dropdown

**Scope:** Config-driven state tax architecture — replaces the hardcoded MO-only assumption with a 50-state lookup table and a user-facing state selector in the wizard.

**Context:** Currently `moFlatRate: 0.047` is hardcoded in DEFAULT_CONFIG and `taxDerived` in App.jsx assumes Missouri flat tax for every user. The wizard (Step 4) already plans for a `userState` dropdown and rate pre-fill — this sprint builds the backend dataset and wires it up.

---

## Mental Model (3 Tax Models)

Every state falls into one of three categories:

```
NONE         → state income tax = 0 (return immediately)
FLAT         → tax = income × flatRate
PROGRESSIVE  → tax = iterate through brackets (same pattern as federal)
```

Once the user selects their state, the app:
1. Pulls `STATE_TAX_TABLE[userState]`
2. Passes income + config into a single `stateTax(income, stateConfig)` function
3. Returns the computed liability — no per-state branching anywhere else in the app

---

## State Breakdown

**No Income Tax (model: "NONE"):**
Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming

**Flat Tax (model: "FLAT"):**
Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi*, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah

*Mississippi: transitioning system, effectively flat after a threshold — model as FLAT for now, leave room to upgrade later.

**Progressive (model: "PROGRESSIVE"):**
Everything else — approximately 26 states + DC.

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
- **Washington** — doesn't tax wages, only capital gains. Treat as NONE for income tax. Do not apply normal income tax logic.
- **Massachusetts** — mostly flat (5%) but has a high-income surtax layer above ~$1M. Treat as FLAT for MVP (irrelevant at this income level).
- **Missouri** — flat at 4.7%. Already correct; just migrates to the table.

---

## Data Shape

```js
// src/constants/stateTaxTable.js  (new file)

export const STATE_TAX_TABLE = {
  // No income tax
  AK: { model: "NONE" },
  FL: { model: "NONE" },
  NV: { model: "NONE" },
  NH: { model: "NONE" },
  SD: { model: "NONE" },
  TN: { model: "NONE" },
  TX: { model: "NONE" },
  WA: { model: "NONE" },  // wages only; capital gains separate
  WY: { model: "NONE" },

  // Flat tax
  AZ: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.025 },
  CO: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.044 },
  GA: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.055 },
  ID: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.058 },
  IL: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.0495 },
  IN: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.0305 },
  IA: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.038 },
  KY: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.04 },
  LA: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.03 },
  MI: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.0425 },
  MS: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.047 },  // transitioning; revisit
  MO: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.047 },
  NC: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.045 },
  OH: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.035 },  // simplified; verify brackets at target income
  PA: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.0307 },
  UT: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.0465 },
  MA: { model: "FLAT", flatRate: 0.05 },   // surtax irrelevant at this income level

  // Progressive — brackets filled in per state
  // Example shape:
  // CA: { model: "PROGRESSIVE", brackets: [{ min: 0, max: 10099, rate: 0.01 }, ...] },
  // (remaining 26 states + DC populated at build time)
};
```

**Note:** Rate accuracy should be verified against each state's 2026 published tax tables before launch. The flat rates listed above are based on current law as of planning; some states adjust annually.

## New Calculation Function

```js
// src/lib/finance.js — add alongside fedTax()

export function stateTax(income, stateConfig) {
  if (!stateConfig || stateConfig.model === "NONE") return 0;
  if (stateConfig.model === "FLAT") return income * stateConfig.flatRate;
  if (stateConfig.model === "PROGRESSIVE") {
    let tax = 0, prev = 0;
    for (const { max, rate } of stateConfig.brackets) {
      if (income <= prev) break;
      tax += (Math.min(income, max ?? Infinity) - prev) * rate;
      prev = max ?? Infinity;
    }
    return tax;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Config Changes

**`DEFAULT_CONFIG` additions (`src/constants/config.js`):**

```js
userState: "MO",          // two-letter state code; drives STATE_TAX_TABLE lookup
```

**`DEFAULT_CONFIG` deprecations (kept for migration, not surfaced in wizard):**
- `moFlatRate` — replaced by `STATE_TAX_TABLE[config.userState].flatRate`
- Remove once migration confirmed safe (check `db.js` migration logic)

---

## App.jsx Wiring

In `taxDerived`, replace:
```js
const mL = tt * config.moFlatRate;  // current: hardcoded MO
```
with:
```js
import { STATE_TAX_TABLE } from '../constants/stateTaxTable';
import { stateTax } from '../lib/finance';

const stateConfig = STATE_TAX_TABLE[config.userState] ?? STATE_TAX_TABLE["MO"];
const mL = stateTax(fAGI, stateConfig);  // use AGI same as federal (verify per-state)
```

Also update `moWithheldBase` label/variable name to `stateWithheldBase` for clarity.

---

## Wizard Integration

**Step 4 (Tax Rates)** — state dropdown already planned:
- Dropdown populated from `Object.keys(STATE_TAX_TABLE)` sorted alphabetically by full state name
- On select: look up `STATE_TAX_TABLE[code]` → derive `stateRateLow` pre-fill
  - NONE → pre-fill 0%, show note "Your state has no income tax"
  - FLAT → pre-fill `flatRate` directly
  - PROGRESSIVE → run `stateTax(estimatedGross, stateConfig) / estimatedGross` as a rough effective rate for display; user confirms against paystub

**Step 5 (Annual Tax Strategy)** — update the field label:
- "MO flat rate" → "[State] state tax rate" (derived from `userState` + table)
- If model is NONE: hide the field entirely, show "Your state has no income tax — no state liability to plan around."
- If model is PROGRESSIVE: show effective rate note, not flat rate

## Files to Create / Modify

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/constants/stateTaxTable.js` | **Create** — full `STATE_TAX_TABLE` dataset |
| `src/lib/finance.js` | Add `stateTax(income, stateConfig)` function |
| `src/constants/config.js` | Add `userState: "MO"` to DEFAULT_CONFIG |
| `src/App.jsx` | Replace `moFlatRate` usage in `taxDerived` with `stateTax()` lookup |
| `src/components/SetupWizard.jsx` | State dropdown in Step 4; conditional Step 5 display |

---

## Build Order

1. `stateTaxTable.js` — build the dataset (NONE + FLAT states first; progressive states can be stubbed as FLAT initially with a TODO comment)
2. `finance.js` — add `stateTax()` function
3. `config.js` — add `userState`; keep `moFlatRate` for now as fallback
4. `App.jsx` — swap `taxDerived` to use `stateTax()` lookup; verify MO output unchanged
5. `SetupWizard.jsx` — wire state dropdown to `userState`; add NONE/FLAT/PROGRESSIVE display logic in Steps 4 & 5

---

## Verification

1. Default load (MO) → `taxDerived.moLiability` unchanged from before the migration
2. Switch `userState` to "TX" → state liability = $0; Step 5 hides state rate field
3. Switch `userState` to "CA" → progressive brackets calculate correctly vs. manual check
4. Flat state (e.g. "IL") → `stateTax(50000, IL_config)` = $2,475 (50000 × 0.0495)
5. Wizard Step 4: select state → rate pre-fills in paystub calculator; user can override
6. Old `moFlatRate` config key in Supabase → db.js migration handles gracefully (no crash on existing rows)
